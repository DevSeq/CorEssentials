# CorEssentials GAMMA
CorEssentials is an open source corexy 3D printer.

ToDo until release of GAMMA-files
- everything

# changes compared to BETA
- increased built volume of 350 mm x 350 mm x 350 mm (comes with increased foot print)+
- base-frame structure built from 2020 aluminium extrusion (most people find the "plates only" design daunting because they are not able to produce the plates)
- MGN12 rails for x- and y-axis
- 9mm belts for x-, y- and z-axis
- easy-accessible filament doors (change filament from the outside)
- optional desicant compartment and filament sensor for each spool
- HEPA-Filter with 140mm fan and additional activated carbon filter
- improved direct drive Tool Head with quick-swab hotends
- support for the ZESTY NIMBLE V2
- special designed expansion PCB for Duet Wifi for 2 Additional (Polulu Style) stepper drivers, 2 Mosfets (LED / FAN) and 1 Thermistor
- optional: IDEX xy Motion system Instead of CoreXY

# changes compared to ALPHA & / OR BETA
- Bed Leveling: Hardware bed leveling with 3 independent motors
- HEPA-Filter
- support for Dual Extrusion with E3D Chimera AQUA
- water cooling with Alphacool Eisbaer Solo
- 40 mm more z-height compared to ALPHA
- better idler mount for xy motion
- better belt Tensioner for z-axis
